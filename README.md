# DoggoCNN



DoggoCNN is a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) capable of classifying cats and dogs with %81 accuracy.

  - Trained on 4000 cat and 4000 dog pictures ([Small version of this Kaggle Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) )
  -  %81 accuracy on training set


## Tech

DoggoCNN uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* Keras
